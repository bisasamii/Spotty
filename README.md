# Spotty
A quadruped Robot Dog based on the Boston Dynamics Spot
This repository contains all documentation, CAD files, electronic schematics.

## Project Overview

Spotty is a four-legged (quadruped) open-source robot designed as a low-threshold learning platform for young talents interested in robotics and quantum technologies. The robot is constructed from PLA and can be extended with various modules, including a low-cost NV-based quantum sensor. The project aims to inspire curiosity and provide practical access to complex technologies.

Key features:
- Modular quadruped design inspired by Boston Dynamics' Spot
- Controlled by a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller with Adafruit PCA9685 for servo control
- 3D-printed components
- Integration of a basic NV-center quantum sensor (fluorescence-based magnetometer)
- Open-source hardware and software for educational purposes

## Repository Contents

- `/CAD`: 3D models (STL) for robot parts
- `/Electronics`: Schematics, wiring diagrams, and bill of materials
- `/Code`: Arduino/Teensy code for robot and remote
- `/Docs`: Detailed documentation

## Getting Started

1. Print the necessary parts using FDM 3D printing (recommended material: PLA).
2. Assemble the mechanical components and electronics following the guides in `/Docs`.
3. Upload the code from `/Code` to your MCUs.
4. Explore and extend Spotty!

## Requirements

- Electronics from bill of materials
- Basic tools for 3D printing and electronics assembly
